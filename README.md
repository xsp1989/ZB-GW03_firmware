# ZB-GW03_firmware

We have built tasmota firmware in all languages based on ZB-GW03. The ETH version has wifi turned off by default, and it can be used after power-on without configuring the template. If you need to check the IP address, you can use the mdns tool to scan the network to find tasmota's gateway, and you can also log in to the background of your router to check the gateway's IP address. If the ETH version does not meet your needs, you can also use the WIFI&ETH version without additional configuration.
